# 10 Bands - A Drake Video Game

### Whut?
This is an open source video game I made based on the Drake song "10 Bands." I made it as a challenge to myself to build a game within two weeks around my birthday in 2016. It is built using the LibGDX video game development framework. 

### How?
10 Bands is a gyroscope game (like the old school wooden marble maze games) where you play as Drake and must collect enough bands to proceed to the next level. There are only four levels, "10 Bands," "50 Bands," "100 Bands" and "Fuck it Man." You must avoid sleeping men ("OMG, n\*\*\*\*s sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep") and cell phones ("I been in the crib with the phones off, I been at the house taking no calls"). The last level is purposely built to be impossible to beat. The amount of bands needed to win is the max value of an integer in Java (2,147,483,647) and the level has collidable traps everywhere. If you can beat 100 bands I'll consider you a winner :D

### Anything Else I Need to Know?
I made this game in 2016 and my LibGDX knowledge has expanded since then. The code is not perfect and is not regularly updated as this is not a game available on the app stores. Please be aware that there are practically no comments and that I'm aware the architecture could be better to be more efficient for a LibGDX game. There may also be some bugs (eg. I know sometimes on the first level a stack of cash will generate behind a sleeping person and I thought it was fixed a long time ago)

### Installation Instructions (Android)
**NOTE**

This game is only available for mobile devices as it requires the gyroscope. When I learn how to run the game on iOS devices I will post the instructions here.
1. Make sure your phone allows the installation of "Unknown Sources." Sometimes your phone will direct to this option when you try installing an APK yourself, but some phones wont.
2. Download the compiled APK [here](https://github.com/HeinousGames/Drake-10Bands/blob/master/android/Drake%20-%2010%20Bands%20-%20GAME.apk?raw=true). You can download and install directly from your phone, or download to a computer and manually move it to your phone before installing.
